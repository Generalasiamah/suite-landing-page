This Landing Page was created using just HTML and CSS. This project can be easily customized for any other product. 
You would just have change the logo and the text. It looks amazing on various viewports since it was made to be responsive. The colour pallete used is very
subtle yet makes for a beautiful outlook. The users of your app are meant to be made aware of your fantastic software features and this landing page uses the clear visuals, light colors, and neatly aligned pieces to get that message across. No framework was used.<br>

<br> Only grid and three flexboxes were used, highlighting the simplicity. There are no distractions and page is focused on the goal of getting the user to download
 your apps. The call to action button is designed to entice the users, it is designed with a wonderful graident of three colours. This landing page also consists of social proof. It has a beautiful and simple testimonial section that can be
 customized.<br>

<br> Code is very clean and easy to read but might need just a little refactoring. Correct html tags are used throughout, which helps in search engine optimazation. <br>
